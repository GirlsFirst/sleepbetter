# SleepBetter
Hello, a group of 3 girls (Eunice, Emily, Karen) made this project with Tkinter. 
To run: Download Python 3 Version for your operating system and Pygame (type: pip install pygame in terminal, may vary depending on your operating system)
        Download images and audio folders from this github and save in the same location as the sleepBetter.py file.
        Create a file called "text.txt" in your text editor.
        Run. 

Done.
